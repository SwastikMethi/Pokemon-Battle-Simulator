# Pokemon Battle Simulation MCP Server

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI models with access to Pokemon data and battle simulation capabilities. This server acts as a bridge between AI assistants like Claude Desktop and the Pokemon world, enabling both data retrieval and interactive battle simulations.

## 🎮 Features
### Part 1: Pokemon Data Resource
Comprehensive Pokemon Information: Stats, types, abilities, moves, and evolution data
Type Effectiveness System: Complete 18-type matchup chart with accurate multipliers
Real-time API Integration: Connects to PokéAPI for up-to-date Pokemon data
Intelligent Caching: Optimized performance with local data caching

### Part 2: Battle Simulation Tool
Advanced Battle Mechanics: Official Pokemon damage formula implementation
Type Effectiveness Calculations: Super effective, not very effective, and immunity handling
Turn-Based Combat: Speed-based turn order with speed-tie resolution
Status Effects System: Burn, Paralysis, and Poison with authentic mechanics
Detailed Battle Logs: Turn-by-turn narration with damage calculations and status updates
First-Turn Immunity: Realistic battle flow where the first attacker cannot be paralyzed

### Final_response:
I can simulate a Pokémon battle between Lugia and Raichu to see who would win! Let me run that battle for you.**Lugia wins!** 

The battle was surprisingly close at first - Raichu's Thunder Punch was super effective against Lugia (thanks to the Flying type) and dealt massive damage right off the bat, reducing Lugia from 106 HP down to just 45 HP in one hit!

However, Lugia's superior stats and bulk allowed it to survive and counter-attack. Lugia's Whirlwind not only dealt consistent damage but also inflicted poison and paralysis status effects on Raichu. The combination of ongoing poison damage and paralysis preventing Raichu from moving sealed the Electric-type's fate.

Key factors:
- **Raichu's advantage**: Thunder Punch was super effective against Flying-type Lugia
- **Lugia's advantages**: Much higher base stats (680 vs 485), better bulk to survive the super effective hit, and status-inducing moves that wore down Raichu over time

Even though Raichu had the type advantage, Lugia's legendary status and superior stats ultimately prevailed in just 2 turns!
